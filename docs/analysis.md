## Introduction
This analysis provides an overview of the Rust codebase for a command-line interface application that utilizes Ollama, an open-source framework designed for running language models.

## Dependencies and Imports
The code imports various libraries including `clap` for CLI argument handling, `ollama_rs`, standard Rust libraries (`std::error`, `std::path`, `tokio`), and other utilities required to function.

## Main Components
### Function Implementations
Three primary functions are defined:
- **read_file**: Reads the contents of a file with error checking for non-file paths and empty files.
- **list_files**: Lists files within a specified directory, ensuring path validity before proceeding.
- **edit_file**: Replaces specific text in a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist or constructing necessary directories.

### Command Line Arguments
The application leverages `clap` for argument parsing with options:
- `model_name`: Specifies which model to use (defaults to "cogito:14b")
- `debug`: Enables debug mode
- `ctx_size`: Determines the context size used by the model

### Main Function
The program initializes an Ollama client, sets up a chat coordinator with access to predefined tools, and implements a loop for continuous user input handling.

## Features
The application provides:
- Language model interaction via CLI interface
- File system operations integration (read, list, edit)
- Context customization through command-line arguments

## Error Handling and Robustness
Robust error handling is implemented using Rust's Result type, ensuring proper management of potential issues during execution. Async/await syntax enables non-blocking I/O operations for improved responsiveness.

## User Interface
A simple CLI interface uses color-coded prompts:
- **User Input**: Blue (`\x1b[34mYou: >`)
- **Assistant Responses**: Yellow (`\x1b[33mAssistant: >`) with the ability to exit by typing "exit".
